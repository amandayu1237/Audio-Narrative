# Audio Narrative
 Composing Digital Media

Summery: 

	My audio narrative focuses on my journey of overcoming the stigma surrounding community college, illustrating how my initial embarrassment transformed into appreciation for its benefits. I chose this narrative because it reflects a significant turning point in my academic journey and challenges the misconceptions that many students internalize. My purpose is to break down these stereotypes and highlight the financial and academic advantages of community college. By sharing my own experiences, alongside interviews with other transfer students and insights from professors, I aim to reassure high school students and current community college students that this path is not only valid but can be empowering.
	To bring my story to life, I used audio to create a personal and engaging experience. Sound effects played an important role in highlighting key moments—like a ticking clock to show the stress of making college decisions, whispering voices to reflect the judgment I felt from others, and classroom sounds to set the scene. Music helped shape the mood, starting off unsure and reflective but becoming more uplifting by the end. I structured the story like a roadmap, using checkmark sounds to show important milestones, leading up to a final celebratory moment when I transferred to a four-year university. This approach reinforced the idea that community college wasn’t a setback but a smart and valuable step forward.
	I also included a quote from the article “It’s just too much’: Why students are abandoning community colleges in droves,” which highlights the steep decline in community college enrollment. I used a statistic from the article to show how dropout rates have increased over time, emphasizing the challenges students face in these institutions. By including this data, I wanted to acknowledge the struggles many community college students experience while also reinforcing why it’s important to challenge the stigma. Despite these challenges, community college can still be a valuable option for many, providing affordable education and a strong foundation for future success.
	Reflecting on this process, I found that audio storytelling required me to think differently about pacing, tone, and audience engagement. Using Audacity to edit my narrative was a learning experience, as I experimented with layering sounds and adjusting volume levels to create a more dynamic piece. The biggest challenge was balancing narration with sound effects so that neither overpowered the other. However, through multiple rounds of editing and feedback, I was able to refine my composition into a compelling story that not only challenges stigma but also encourages students to see the value of community college.
