# Audio Narrative
 Composing Digital Media

Summery: My audio narrative explores the stigma surrounding community college and how it shaped my academic journey. Initially, I believed the stereotype that community college was a lesser option, but financial practicality led me to reconsider. Through personal reflections and interviews, I highlight its benefits—affordability, academic growth, and smoother university transitions. My goal is to challenge misconceptions and connect with students facing similar doubts. By integrating feedback and creative audio elements, I hope to reshape perceptions of community college’s value.
